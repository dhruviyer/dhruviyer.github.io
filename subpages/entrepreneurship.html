				<li><h2>Cofounder, 2015-Present </h2></li>
				<li>Allbeat was a startup launched with the help of <a href="http://adisidapara.com">Adi Sidapara</a> and Viraj Puri. I cofounded the company in 2015, after <a href="http://launchsummer.org">MIT Launch</a> to address the increasing difficulty for music lovers to connect with new artists. The app is a social platform, meant to introduce up and coming artists to users through the medium of 11 second sound previews. Our mobile application allows for users to customize their feeds to refine their preferences, as well as share, like, and comment on quality music. Our applcation is set to release in early October.<br><br><br></li>
				<li><h1>Drop Sciences</a></h1></li>
				<li><h2>Cofounder, 2015</h2></li>
				<li>Drop Sciences was the company I cofounded while participating in MIT Launch. The company was founded to improve the efficiency of evacuation of high-rise buildings during a fire evacuation. In addition, it looked to assist vulnerable populations in escaping buildings during a fire emergency. The product was a ceiling-mounted device which dropped oxygen-supplied respirators to protect against smoke and noxious fumes. Though we have since stopped the project, we succeeded in developing a prototype and aquiring a provisional patent.</li>
