				<h1>Si Se Puede Foundation</h1>
				<h2>2012-Present </h2>
				The Si Se Puede Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which works to develop an interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math fields among minority and at-risk youth. 
				<br><br>I joined SSP in 2012, where I began volunteering in the robotics center, teaching middle and elementary school students about the basic engineering principles behind LEGO Robotics, in preparation for the FIRST LEGO League robotics competition. After 300 hours of volunteering, I became head mentor of the junior program, directly overseeing 80 students, while personally mentoring 14. A year after I became head mentor, the team I mentored became the 1<sup>st</sup> team from Si Se Puede to qualify for the State Championship in 10 years.
				<br><br>Besides mentoring teams and working in the robotics division, I was also aprominent media outreach contact for Si Se Puede. I have represented the organization on news channels including an appearance on PBS <em>Horizonte</em>. I also operated booths at AZ SciTech festivals and was a panelist and keynote speaker at the Si Se Puede South Mountain STEM Education conference.
