			<h1>Founding President of FIRST Robotics Team 5465: The Binary Bots</h1>
			In 2015, I was asked by the CEO of the Si Se Puede Foundation, Alberto Esparza, to start a community robotics team focused on teaching high school students, especially those from low-income neighborhoods, basic engineering design principles. This is how I became the founder of FRC team 5465. In our rookie year, we had only 6 students, but through hardwork and tenacity, we won the "Rookie All-star" award and were sent to the FIRST Robotics World Championships in St. Louis, Missouri. There, we picked up skills and expertise from some of the best teams in FRC. Our two seniors graduated and went on to pursue engineering degrees, and I had built a sustainable robotics club for the Si Se Puede Foundaton. During the summer of 2015, I solo built a robot to teach myself the skills necessary to lead the team. In our next season, we doubled in numbers and built a more complex robot that allowed us to effectively participate in the 2016 game. I produced the highlight reel below which shows our successful second season.
